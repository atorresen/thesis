	<h1>HELP ME MAKE ART WITH MATH</h1>

	<h2>a Kolakoski sequence wire-folding activity</h2>

	<p>Hi! I’m AnneMarie, a grad student at RISD. I’m working on a project about experiencing 
		math via art, and I want your help.</p>

	<br>
	<p>
	On <span>Monday, March 2 at 5pm in Kassar Room 105</span>, I’ll be holding a math/art workshop. 
	I’ll introduce you to the Kolakoski sequence, then have you bend wire in a 
	Kolakoski-sequence-inspired pattern. I’ll take your bent wires — and trade you a zine for 
	your efforts :) — and assemble them into a sculpture that will appear at the RISD Grad 
	Thesis Show (May 20-30 at the RI Convention Center). <span>If you bend a wire, then your name will 
	be listed as a contributing artist!</span></p>
	</p>

	<p>
		Please join us: 5pm, Monday March 2, in Kassar 105 — the event will last 30-40 minutes, 
		and you <span>don’t need to bring anything except your brain and your hands.</span>
	</p>

	<h3>more about the project:</h3>
	<div class="longText">
	<p>In first grade, I wanted to be an artist. Academics tugged me through theorems and through theses, so it wasn’t until art school that I realized that I had already, all along, been realizing that first dream.</p>
	<p>Anyone who is thoughtful and expressive is an artist. Art can look like anything. It can be calculated. It can be researched. It can be total mystery. It can be radical clarity. It can jerk painfully along in starts and stops. It can be a dizzying, ceaseless loop. It can be made of passion or wishes or paper or clay or electricity or footsteps or numbers.</p>
	<p>The Kolakoski sequence first crossed my path in Explorations in Mathematical Research, a course whose description began “This course is not like any other in the mathematics department. The course is designed to show you how new mathematics is actually created.”
		(<a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/ibl/instruction-courses/#:~:text=Math%20389%20%E2%80%93%20Explorations%20in%20Mathematics,-Course%20Description%3A%C2%A0This">University of Michigan</a>) It was in this course that I first became aware of the possibility of taking an artistic approach to mathematical research.</p>
	<p>In grade school, math teachers are expected to have the answer to every question they pose to students. Math needs to be masterable, and students’ mastery needs to be measurable by their performance on exams. The content of math courses is defined by administrative bodies who have a vague idea that students will need to “use” math in something they call “real life,” so they present math as a collection of tools that can be employed in specific, predetermined situations. Even at the undergraduate level, most math courses include summaries of major mathematical discoveries, but reveal little of how or why the content was created in the first place.</p>
	<p>Studying math the way most teachers offer is akin to studying art by taking only art history courses, and perhaps occasionally copying a work of art that already exists. It is like learning about poetry by only ever reading the top 100 most-quoted lines of Shakespeare, never in context and never out loud. Math teacher Paul Lockhart compares the current state of math education to learning about music only through notation, without ever hearing a song. Drawing out this metaphor, Lockhart laments that “not many students actually go on to concentrate in music, so only a few will ever get to hear the sounds that the black dots represent.”
		(<a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Lockhart_2002_-_A_Mathematician's_Lament.pdf">Paul Lockhart, "A Mathematician's Lament"</a>) Indeed, very few ever get to experience the material, emotional, rhythmic truth that is represented by math.</p>
	<p>Explorations in Mathematical Research broke me out of this limited mathematical model. I got a chance to hum the beginning of my own song and to write my own sentence or two. In the Kolakoski sequence, I found a pattern scintillating in both its simplicity and its vastness. I found a problem I could swim in. I found opportunities to explore math with images and movements and feelings. I experienced math as a creative medium for the first time. There was no exam at the end. Math was made of questions! And these questions did not yet have answers, not even from my professors!</p>
	<p>Years passed, and the Kolakoski sequence continued to come in and out of my mind, even amid the all-consuming work of teaching high school math. When that work came to a halt because of the 2020 pandemic, Kolakoski quickly resurfaced. As a way to add structure to days at once terrifying and listless, I started going on “Kolakoski walks.” I would go to the corner nearest to my apartment, then randomly choose a direction to walk 1 block, then randomly choose a direction to walk 2 blocks, then randomly choose a direction to walk 2 blocks, then randomly choose a direction to walk 1 block, and so on and so on and so on. Sometimes I found myself looping back to the same few blocks several times on a single day, and other days I would walk far from my starting point and encounter streets I had never seen before.</p>
	<p>As I covered more and more sidewalks with the Kolakoski sequence, I felt drawn to draw my routes. I started making diagrams (in hindsight, I started making art), and then, of course, the only reasonable choice was to go to art school. After all, there are things people “must know before they become Artists and these are the secrets which are revealed at Art school.” I needed to get in on these secrets. I needed to get in on the “Agony of the Artist.”
		(<a href="https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/1927/4/the-agony-of-the-artist-with-a-capital-a">e.e. cummings, "The Agony of the Artist (with a capital A)</a>)</p>
	<p>And, boy oh boy, did art school hit me like a ton of feathers. I searched high and low for a “concept,” I felt hopelessly lost, I thought too much, I didn’t sleep enough, I lost my mind, and then one night, as I was tossing and turning, I jolted upright and I said out loud “I am tossing and turning!”</p>
	<p>The agony of the artist is the agony of the mathematician and the agony of both. It is a mournful, reaching, heart-melting oscillation. As ever, I am going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, and each project I do makes me rethink the last one I did while also punting me forward to another new, different, maybe-even-opposite project. Every time (or sometimes every other time) I dig my heels into “I’m doing art now,” I trip and fall into “I’m doing math now.” I’ve been here before. I have come back to where I started. 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, ... </p>
	<p>“It was already ‘there’ waiting for [me], wasn't it”?
	<br>So off I keep going, “self-generating in marvelous order.”
